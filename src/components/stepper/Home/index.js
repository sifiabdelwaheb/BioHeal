                        <p>Steppers display progress through a sequence of logical and numbered steps. They may also be used for navigation. Steppers may display a transient feedback message after a step is saved.</p>

                        <h5 sx={{p:2}}>Linear</h5>
                        <p sx={{p:3}}>A linear stepper allows the user to complete the steps in sequence.
                            The Stepper can be controlled by passing the current step index (zero-based) as the activeStep prop. Stepper orientation is set using the orientation prop.
                            This example also shows the use of an optional step by placing the optional prop on the second Step component. Note that it's up to you to manage when an optional step is skipped. Once you've determined this for a particular step you must set completed={false} to signify that even though the active step index has gone beyond the optional step, it's not actually complete.
                        </p>

                        <h5 sx={{p:2}}>Non Linear</h5>
                        <p sx={{p:3}}>ANon-linear steppers allow the user to enter a multi-step flow at any point.
                            This example is similar to the regular horizontal stepper, except steps are no longer automatically set to disabled={true} based on the activeStep prop.
                            The use of the StepButton here demonstrates clickable step labels, as well as setting the completed flag. However because steps can be accessed in a non-linear fashion, it's up to your own implementation to determine when all steps are completed (or even if they need to be completed).
